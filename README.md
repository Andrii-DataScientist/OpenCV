### A bit uncleaned code so it is not suitable for someone to use, the main problem was for me that cv2.imshow() was working in Jupyter abnormally, so i decided to make commands from bash in jupyter shell with `%%bash` and evoke python script in file.py for example, some code from python files moved to the jupyter but you can't run him directly in Jupyter, instead use shell.
